Welcome, this is the LaTeX code for my master's thesis "Private Database Search".

The thesis itself can be found in the main directory with the filename "PrivateDatabaseSearch.pdf", together with the presentation used for the defense as the file named "PrivateDatabaseSearchPresentation.pdf".

An application that implements the work can be found in the https://github.com/BenjaminHansenMortensen/PrivateDatabaseSearch repository.


Note that the figures used in the presentation is located in the "Presentation_Figures" directory, but are not added to the compiled pdf.
