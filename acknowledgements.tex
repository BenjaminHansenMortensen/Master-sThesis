I want to thank my supervisors, Martin Strand and Håkon Jacobsen, for their continued support and assistance, and the \acrfull{ffi} for enabling this work. I am incredibly grateful for my main supervisor, Martin, who facilitated this work and gave me trust and freedom to explore. He is a cornerstone in the Norwegian cryptology community who wants nothing but what is best for the community and those around him. I am lucky to have been able to work with you. My co-supervisor, Håkon, has been immensely helpful with giving feedback and suggestions for my work, and it would not have been the same without you. Thank you. I am also grateful to the developers and maintainers of MP-SPDZ, as this thesis would not have been possible without it. Thanks also to \acrshort{ffi}, whom I wrote this thesis in partnership with, for providing me with the resources that I required and a platform to engage with subject experts. Special thanks to the cybersecurity and cyberoperations division at \acrshort{ffi} and everyone I engaged with during my time there. Lastly, thanks to the \acrfull{uio} and the \acrfull{ifi} for all their efforts towards making the Information Security master's program such an excellent program.
