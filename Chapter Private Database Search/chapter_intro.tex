It is not trivial to perform private searches on a private database, therefore we take a step back to outline the general idea behind the type of protocols we seek. For now, we are not concerned about the feasibility of such protocols; instead, we want to identify and describe them. We build on the work of Ryan Henry in defining \acrshort{pir} \cite{CCS:Henry17}, we extend the notion of \acrshort{pir} by combining it with \acrshort{psi} to introduce the notion of \acrshort{pds}, a set of protocols that fall under the \acrshort{ot} category. We do so by outlining what a database search protocol is and describe the properties to which a \acrshort{pds} protocol should satisfy. The goal is not to give formal definitions but to relate the descriptions of the properties in a natural way to the desired functionality, for then to later discuss the implications of those descriptions at a lower level of abstraction, \cref{sec:protocolassessment}.
