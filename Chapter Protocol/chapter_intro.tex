\acrshort{pds} is realized by combining \acrshort{psi} and \acrshort{ot}. Therefore, to create a scheme, we propose two \acrshort{psi} protocols where one provides a keyword search functionality and the other a semantic search functionality, and an \acrshort{ot} protocol that allows the client to retrieve records from the database. These protocols interoperate, so to give a clear picture, we start by giving an overview of the communication flow between the client and server. Then, we introduce the \acrshort{ot} protocol in two sections: one that describes the initiation phase and one for the transfer phase. We also separate the \acrshort{psi} protocols into an initiation and a transfer phase. To answer the question of feasibility, we perform experiments that implement the proposed protocols. Lastly, we discuss the results, in the context of the descriptions we gave for the properties of \acrshort{pds}, the practicability and post-quantum security of the proposed protocol.
