We assess the proposed protocol, subprotocols, and the experimentation results in the context of our described \acrshort{pds} properties. We also discuss compliance with the privacy description and its practical implications. Further we elaborate on the experimental results in the context of our timely and storage imbalanced descriptions to discuss their practicability. Lastly, we discuss post-quantum security in the protocol by looking at each subprotocol.
