The dominant space complexity is in the $ \PreProcess $ algorithm. In it, the client picks a key and a counter to produce a key stream for the encryption of every item in the database. This means that the client, at most, has to store a key and a counter for $ n $ items. The counters and keys are each of size $ \beta $, which in bytes are $ \frac{\beta}{8} $. We combine this with the records being of $ \omega $ bytes, giving us the following fraction to calculate their difference $ \frac{4 \cdot \omega}{\beta} $. By our definition of storage imbalanced, we say that the protocol is $ (\frac{4 \cdot \omega}{\beta}) $-imbalanced. We use our experimental data, $ \omega = 6016 $ and $ \beta = 128 $, we find that the proposed solution is $ 188 $-imbalanced, meaning the server requires 188 times more storage than the client.
