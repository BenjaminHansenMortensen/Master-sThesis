The first type of search we present is a keyword search, where the query is compared to the record values. We want this comparison to be done without the server learning the outcome and with the client only learning the indices of the records it is interested in. In other words, we want a \acrshort{psi} protocol that takes in the client's search query $ q $ and the auxiliary information $ A $ from the server, and outputs a set of record indices $ I $ to the client. We split the protocol into an initiation and transfer phase, where most of the work is done in the initiation.
