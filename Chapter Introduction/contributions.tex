Motivation for \acrfull{ot} and \acrfull{spir} often use example use-cases similar to ours \cite{AC:LLMNW17}. However, to the author's best knowledge, no publication has yet been published about implementations for said use-cases. Therefore, the most valuable contribution of this work is that we give an in-depth dissertation of a real-world use case, the \acrshort{pnr} registry, where we use \acrshort{ot} as a practical solution.

In addition, contributions in this work include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item We present \acrfull{pds}, which extends \acrshort{ot}, \acrshort{spir}, and \acrfull{pir} (given that the underlying \acrshort{pir} protocol does not reveal information other than the retrieved records) to facilitate a search functionality of the database for the client.
    \item We propose a private keyword search protocol that has an efficient initiation, and in the online phase has a constant round, time and communication complexity.
    \item We introduce how a \acrfull{llm} can be combined with \acrfull{mpc} to achieve a private semantic search protocol.
    \item We present two \acrfull{ps} protocols, one protocol utilizing symmetric encryption and generic \acrshort{mpc}, and one \acrshort{ot}-based protocol, that allows for the private swap of two elements.
    \item We propose an \acrshort{ot} protocol, that combines oblivious sorting and \acrshort{ps}, to achieve a quasilinear time complexity without parallelization, but with perfect parallelization the time complexity can be reduced to sublinear, and in the online phase has a constant round, time and communication complexity.
